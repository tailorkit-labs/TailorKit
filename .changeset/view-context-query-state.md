Replace `useViewContext`'s status union with `{ context, loading?, error? }` so query data, loading, and errors can be passed together. Keep the view path as the first argument and infer the complete context type from that path. Loading defaults to false, errors take precedence, and loading/error states omit context. Update host examples and documentation to use the new API.

Log diagnostics for ready views with missing required context or context that does not match the server's serialized JSON Schema. Allow omitted optional context, skip loading/error states, and suppress repeated errors for unchanged inputs. Reuse the existing Zod dependency to build JSON Schema context validators.

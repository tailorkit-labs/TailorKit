# @tailorkit/app

## 0.1.0-beta.18

### Patch Changes

- fc9538d: Allow the agent command to search existing apps or create a new app when appId is
  omitted, then save the chosen app ID in the TailorKit config for future launches.

## 0.1.0-beta.17

### Patch Changes

- 364d5cd: Document TailorKitConfig options and their defaults in editor tooltips, and generate new app configs with only the host URL so the backend is enabled explicitly.

## 0.1.0-beta.16

### Minor Changes

- b5c6afc: Consolidate the app SDK in @tailorkit/app and expose app client APIs through tailorkit/client and server APIs through tailorkit/server. Provide SQLite schema builders, synchronous Zod-validated queries/mutations, asynchronous external actions, atomic mutation receipts and typed browser references. Use oRPC v2 HTTP for direct sandbox calls and WebSockets for server-driven query snapshots; the bridge supplies scoped platform JWTs and renews authentication. Execute queries, mutations and actions in one private Cloudflare facet, with an ALS-backed fetch guard and local action query/mutation calls and scoped capabilities for HTTPS egress. Keep synchronous database transactions atomic. Actions do not retry automatically or hold database transactions across external work. Track table dependencies and rerun only active affected queries after commit.

  Upload client and private server bundles with committed Drizzle migrations to separate blob prefixes and load published code into isolated Dynamic Worker SQLite facets through apps/apps-worker. Keep stable installation databases across deployments, trusted Effect v4 coordination, and client-only app compatibility. Store migration sources in migrations/ and copy them to .tailorkit/migrations/. Generate migrations explicitly through tailorkit db generate using Drizzle Kit and the existing TailorKit config, without a separate Drizzle config; builds check the current schema against the latest saved snapshot without rewriting history. Apply pending migrations atomically to each installation before database calls.

  Retire the legacy app-storage SDK, app-platform package, storage CLI commands and bridged database calls. Keep the Apache-2.0 oRPC contract in @tailorkit/app/protocol and execution in the private BUSL-1.1 apps-worker worker. Share private app JWT signing/verification through @tailorkit/api-utils/app-auth, and expose host authorization through backend.resolveInstallation and /backend/session. Effect stays in server auth and trusted runtime code, outside browser entry points.

  Support client.entry and server.entry in tailorkit.config.ts, defaulting to src/client.ts and src/server.ts. Build, deployment type checks, browser/server isolation and API type imports follow the configured entries.

  Share duplicate reactive queries with TanStack Store and retry transient mutation failures with stable receipt IDs. Inline dynamic server imports into one upload, typecheck both app entries, preserve session error codes through the iframe bridge, and mount opaque-origin sandboxes without waiting for backend authentication. Cache published deployment metadata in Cloudflare KV, update it through an authenticated platform-to-worker endpoint, and populate cache misses through the platform API. Existing clients reconnect to the latest server without remounting; deployments must maintain client compatibility.

- efdac76: Breaking change: remove the `loading` and `error` component options from `createView`. Apps must remove these options and provide only `component`. App views now render nothing while host context is loading or in an error state. Internal view states, readiness composition, and ready context access remain unchanged.

## 0.1.0-beta.9

### Minor Changes

- ced9f2f: Add slot-specific app view selection and layered host views. Host contracts now declare `views` and `slots`; app clients register `slots[name][path]`. Each slot selects one matching view and composes context only from that view and its ancestors. Unsupported matches render nothing, and `false` entries stop fallback.

  React integrations now import `Root`, `AppView`, `useApps`, and `useView` directly. Pass the client to `Root`, add a slot to every app view, publish only each view's own context, and regenerate app bindings. Registries are isolated per root.

  Each slot declares a `views` list typed against the global view definitions. Generated app bindings and explicit host mounts enforce the slot-to-view relationship, and runtime matching only considers supported view paths while retaining inherited ancestor context.

  Publish host view state with `useView(path, { context })` or `useView(path, { status })`.

  The iframe runtime is bundled from TypeScript and accepts only default-exported `defineClient()` clients. Demo clients use that same contract. View ancestry is shared between React, the sandbox, and generated bindings. `Root` supplies one app-discovery state: when `apps` is provided, `useApps()` reads it and skips network discovery.
